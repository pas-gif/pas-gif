                <tr>
                    <th>Benefit</th>

                    <td>Weight Management</td>
                    <td>Exercise plays a crucial role in managing body weight by burning calories, which helps in weight loss and preventing weight gain. Combining exercise with a balanced diet can lead to sustainable weight management and reduce the risk of obesity-related conditions.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mental Health Improvement</td>
                    <td>Physical activity has a significant positive impact on mental health. Regular exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, stimulating the release of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters, thus enhancing overall emotional well-being.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Strengthens Bones and Muscles</td>
                    <td>Exercise, particularly weight-bearing and resistance activities, strengthens bones and muscles. This helps prevent osteoporosis and frailty with age, and improves balance and coordination, reducing the risk of falls and fractures.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Enhances Cardiovascular Health</td>
                    <td>Cardiovascular exercises improve heart health by increasing heart rate and promoting better blood circulation. Regular cardio workouts can lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Boosts Immune System</td>
                    <td>Engaging in moderate exercise can boost the immune system by promoting healthy circulation and reducing inflammation. Regular physical activity helps the body’s defense mechanisms work more efficiently, making you less susceptible to illnesses and infections.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Improves Sleep Quality</td>
                    <td>Physical activity can help regulate sleep patterns and improve overall sleep quality. Regular exercise reduces the time it takes to fall asleep, increases deep sleep stages, and helps manage sleep disorders such as insomnia.</td>

                    <td>Enhances Cognitive Function</td>
                    <td>Exercise is linked to improved cognitive function and memory. Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain, supporting better cognitive performance and protecting against age-related cognitive decline.</td>
